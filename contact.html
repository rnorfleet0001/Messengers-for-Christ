            <h2>Make Your Reservation</h2>
          <p>We have attempted to keep the costs low because we realize that some of you will have travel and accommodation expenses.  We are planning some gift bags for all attendees.  We also have to cover the costs of the reception food, musicians, programs, video recording & editing and all printed materials.  We are trying to do as much online as possible to reduce our postage expenses.  If you want to contribute more than the registration fee, free to do so.  To save money, it would help if you would forward a check money order or cashiers check to our treasurer.<br>

            <h3> Registration: $30.00<h3>
              <p> Please respond as soon as possible so we can plan adequately for your attendance.  You can forward you payment to:<br> Cathy Jameson <br>4004 Wooded Way<br>Louisville, KY 40219<br>
