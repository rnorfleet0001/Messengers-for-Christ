         <h3>Messengers for Christ on the Bellevadere - Louisville, Ky circa 1978</h3>

        <main>

          <h2>'1977' - Reunion - '2022'</h2>

          <h2>"Together Again"</h2>
          <p>Please join us as we get-acquainted and get-reacquainted.  It is hard to believe that over four decades have passed since a group of singers founded the Messengers for Christ Interdenominational Community Choir.  The spiritual and musical integrity of the choir has
            been the goal and strength of the Messengers for Christ.  We are organizing and planning a small agenda of activites so that everyone can participate at level that is comfortable for them.
            The registration fee is $30.00.  We have kept the registration fee low because we realize that many of you may have to travel and make other accommodation arrangements.</p>
          <p>
            Below is a list of charter and first year members.  That list is followed by a list of all of our deceased members.  Other membership lists of our directors, musicians, emeritus membership and alumni members will
            be adding later.  If there are persons that need to be listed please respond on the contact page with additional names.</p>


          <h3>Reunion Activities</h3>


          <h4>Labor Day Weekend 2022</h4>


          <h4>Thursday & Friday, September 1st and 2nd - Rehearsals</h4>
              <p>Rehearsals will be held throughout the year.  Persons that cannot attend the rehearsals may receive a playlist with lyrics and recordings.</p>

              <h4>Saturday, September 3, Rehearsal and Reunion Reception</h4>
              <p>The final dress rehearsal and sound check will be held on Saturday, September 3.  The Reunion Reception will be held after the rehearsal. This is where we will have
                a memorial for all of our deceased member.  We will also recognize founders, directors, officers, musicians and other members.  This is will save us time in the Sunday concert. <p>
                <p>Please register so we can make accommodations
                for everyone that plans to attend.  Hopefully, as many as possible can attend the Saturday events because a photographer will be on hand to take photos for our archives.</p>


              <h4>Sunday, September 4, Reunion Concert</h4>
              <p>The Reunion Concert will certainly be the highlight of the weekend's activiities.  We will include some of our most remembered songs.  We will again have briefly
                recognitions of our previous members.</p>
