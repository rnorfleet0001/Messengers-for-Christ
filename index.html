                <h3>History</h3>
                <p>Since 1977 over 250 persons have participated as directors, singers and musicians in this choir.</p>

                <p>The Messengers for Christ Interdenominational Choir was organized in 1977 under the leadership of Ben Smith and Ed Luney.  We are now moving forward as the MFC Intergenerational Choir to encompass the vast range of ages of our current membership.  The choir's charter members consisted of some of the former members of the Kentucky State University Gospel Ensemble.  Other directors included the late Joseph Wallace Tiggs, Sherman Lamont Bush and Kevin Brian James.  Since 1989 the choir has been under the direction of Ronnie von Pierre Norfleet.</p>

    <br>

    <p> The musical heritage and legacy of this choir was established at the beginning.  Since then, the standards of vocal and instrumental music have persisted throughout these years.  The unique traditional and contemporary sound has remained the same.  The blending of voices and balancing of parts has always been a unique feature of the Messengers for Christ.  We are grateful for the instruction, tutoring and musical acumen that the directors and musicians have provided.
