                <h3>History</h3>
                <p>Since 1977 over 250 persons have participated as singers and musicians in this choir.</p>

                <p>The Messengers for Christ Intergenerational (formerly Interdenominational) Choir was organized in 1977 under the leadership of Ben Smith and Ed Luney.  The choir's charter members consisted of some of the former members of the Kentucky State University Gospel Ensemble.  Other directors included the late Joseph Wallace Tiggs, Sherman Lamont Bush and Kevin Brian James.  Since 1989 the choir has been under the direction of Ronnie von Pierre Norfleet.</p>

                <p>Yes, in '2022' the choir will celebrate 45 years of music ministry.</p>

                <p>Forty-five years is a long time for any singing aggregation.  We will take this opportunity to celebrate and give thanks to God for sustaining the choir over these many years.  The choir has been presenting worship and benefit concerts for many religious, educational, civic and community organizations.  We are planning a wonderful weekend of activities for Labor Day Weekend, Thursday, September 1 - Monday, September 5, 2021</p>
